# Handle

<br>

## Introduction

Handle is a Minecraft plugin suite written for the Bukkit API, and it contains a number of miscellaneous server tools.

I plan for it to be the project hub of the majority of my custom plugins. Many will end up being implemented on my Minecraft server, [Vality](https://playvality.com).

Currently I'm only supporting Minecraft version 1.18.

## Installation

1. First, download or clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/j3kennard/handle-bukkit.git
```

2. Build the JAR files using Maven.

3. Drop the JARs into your server's `plugins` folder, restart the server, and you're good to go!
